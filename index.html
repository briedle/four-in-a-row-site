    <h1> Let's play a fun game of Four-in-a-Row!!</h1>
    <!-- <img src="images/four-in-a-row.jpg" alt="Four in a Row is Fun!!" /> -->
    <p>"Four-in-a-Row is a classic two-player connection game where the objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Each player takes turns dropping colored discs into a (typically) seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The game requires strategy and foresight, as players must not only focus on creating their own line of four but also prevent their opponent from doing so. It's a simple yet engaging game that combines easy-to-understand rules with deep strategic play."Read the <a
