    <p> Four-in-a-Row is a classic strategy game that challenges players to connect a sequence of
    four of their colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, within a
    grid. The game unfolds on a vertical standing board where participants take turns dropping one
    of their discs into any of the seven columns. The objective is to outsmart the opponent by
    strategically placing discs and blocking their attempts to create a winning alignment. With its
    simple yet engaging gameplay, Four-in-a-Row offers a delightful balance of skill and intuition,
    making it a timeless and enjoyable two-player experience. Read the <a
