# Four-in-a-Row Game

Welcome to the Four-in-a-Row game repository! This project aims to create a simple and fun implementation of the classic Connect Four game.

## Overview

Four-in-a-Row is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent.

## Features

- Interactive and responsive game board.
- Two-player turn-based gameplay.
- Winning condition detection for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
